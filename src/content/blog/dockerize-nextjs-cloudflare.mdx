# Dockerizing Next.js: The Right Way

Containerizing a Next.js application isn't just `COPY . .`. To get a production-ready image that is small, secure, and fast, you need **Multi-Stage Builds**.

Let's walk through creating an optimized Dockerfile and deploying it.

## The Optimized Dockerfile

We will split our build into three stages:
1.  **Deps**: Install dependencies.
2.  **Builder**: Build the Next.js app.
3.  **Runner**: The minimal production runtime.

```dockerfile
# 1. Install Dependencies
FROM node:18-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# 2. Build the App
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
# Disable telemetry for privacy
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1
RUN npm run build

# 3. Production Image
FROM node:18-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV production
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

# Create a non-root user for security
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

# Copy necessary files only
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public

# Automatically leverage output traces to reduce image size
# https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/output-file-tracing
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/static ./.next/static

USER nextjs

EXPOSE 3000
ENV PORT 3000

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

### Key Optimizations:
- **`standalone` mode**: Next.js can output a standalone folder with only the necessary files. You need to enable this in `next.config.ts`:
  ```ts
  const nextConfig = {
    output: 'standalone',
  };
  ```
- **Non-root user**: Running as `root` is a security risk. We create a `nextjs` user.
- **Alpine Linux**: Uses a lightweight Linux distribution to keep image size down.

## Deploying to Cloudflare (Workers vs Pages vs Containers)

Cloudflare is famous for **Workers** (Edge functions), but they don't natively support Docker containers in the traditional sense yet (though standard Next.js on Pages is great).

However, for a *Dockerized* deployment, we often look at platforms that support containers on the edge or serverless, like **Fly.io** or **Railway**, while using Cloudflare as the DNS/Proxy/CDN layer.

**Wait! Cloudflare released "Workers for Platforms" and highly supports Next.js via `opennext` on Cloudflare Pages.**

If you *must* use Docker, you are likely deploying to a VPS or a container runner (like AWS ECS or Google Cloud Run) and proxied by Cloudflare.

### The "Cloudflare Way" (No Docker)

If you want the true Cloudflare experience, skip Docker and use **Cloudflare Pages**:

1. Connect your GitHub repo to Cloudflare Pages.
2. Framework Preset: `Next.js`.
3. Build Command: `npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages`.
4. Deploy.

This converts your Next.js API routes into **Cloudflare Workers**, running globally at the edge with 0ms cold starts (mostly).

## Summary

- **Docker**: Best for portability, complex backends, and hosting on AWS/GCP/Fly.io.
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Best for pure Next.js apps that want global edge performance without managing containers.

Choose the right tool for the job!
